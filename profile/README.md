# CLIA

**Human-centered automation and agent orchestration.**

CLIA (Command Line Interface Agent) is a framework for creating and collaborating with AI agents. We focus on local-first engineering environments, verifiable contributions, and robust agency modeling.

### Key Workstreams
- **Agent Platform:** Building the core engine for cross-platform agentic workflows.
- **Triad Modeling:** Standardizing governance through Agent, Agency, and Agenda triads.
- **Operator Workflows:** Crafting tools that make complex automation feel human and simple.
